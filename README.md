# Rentomatic
Rentomatic is a Tenant/Landlord portal web application project done for Term 6 Elements of Software Construction module. The application uses the MERN stack (ReactJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, NodeJS) and functions shown in the demo are fully implemented. The web application essentially is a service ticket system, where the tenant is able to create a ticket for any maintenance works needed, and the landlord is able to resolve the ticket. Due to this being a client project, I am unable to share the code that has been implemented for the project, but the demo video shows how the system works.
